## What is Digital Literacy?

### The Concept of Literacy

Let’s first start with “What is literacy?” Dictionaries define literacy as the ability to read and write. Within education, literacy is understood as the ability to read, write, and use arithmetic; the emphasis is on proficiency with language and numeracy.

It is important to pause and note that the term literacy has always held a degree of status. Globally, countries are often ranked in terms of literacy rates, compared by what percent of the adult population can read and write, for example. There is more complexity to the terms literate or illiterate, however, and a lot depends on context. “New literacy studies” view literacy as a situated practice; as in it all depends on where you come from and what your purpose is.

### Activity #2
#### How is literacy depicted on the Internet?

> Use a common search engine like Google and type the term “literacy” into the search bar. Select the option to view the results as images and scroll through the visual depictions of literacy. What do these images depict about the concept of literacy?

Much of what you find in your search will probably suggest a relationship between literacy and words. This may be attributed to the fact that the concept has traditionally been associated with language—i.e., alphabetic literacy. In popular use, the word literacy has increasingly become a synonym for skill, competence, and proficiency—for example, emotional literacy and spiritual literacy, etc.

To better understand Digital Literacy, it is helpful to clarify the relationship between literacy, competence, and skills. While these terms are interconnected, they reflect different layers of capability and application.

**Literacy** is the broadest concept, referring to the foundational ability to understand, interpret, and produce information within a specific context. That information may be in the form of written text, music, art, or any other way of encoding. Literacy serves as the basis for developing competencies and skills.

**Competence** is a subset of literacy, representing a specific set of skills and contextual understanding to apply knowledge effectively in real-world scenarios. Competence is dynamic, requiring not only technical ability but also judgment, communication, and problem-solving.

**Skills** are the most specific and practical element, representing the very specific technical abilities or techniques used to perform tasks. While skills are essential teachable components, they gain significance when practiced within the broader context of competence and guided by the framework provided by literacy.

In summary, literacy is the overarching framework that enables individuals to develop competencies, which in turn depend on specific skills.

### Activity

> Have a think about the activities you undertake in your everyday life. Pick one, and think about it in terms of literacy, competencies and skills. What do these things look like in that context? For example, you might be an aspiring guitar player. 

| Aspect | Example |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Skill | Playing a basic chord (e.g., G major) |
| Competency | Switching between chords smoothly in a song |
| Literacy | Understanding music theory and applying it to guitar playing |

Now that you've identified literacy, competency, and skill in an everyday activity, let’s consider how we recognise these in practice.
A **behavioural indicator** is an observable action that demonstrates someone’s level of literacy, competency, or skill. In education, we often assess learning by looking at these indicators.

Thinking about the activity you examined in the earlier activity, identify at least one behavioural indicator for each level. For example, in the context of playing the guitar:

| Aspect | Example | Behavioral Indicator |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Skill | Playing a basic chord (e.g., G major) | Fingers are placed correctly, the chord rings out cleanly |
| Competency | Switching between chords smoothly in a song | Transitions between chords are fluid and in time with the beat |
| Literacy | Understanding music theory and applying it to guitar playing | Can improvise over a chord progression, transposes a song to a different key |

So I might consider myself somewhat competent, my degree of literacy as a guitarist will depend on context. I might be deemed literate in a singalong with friends, but not so in a band context.

Whatever your view of the word literacy, what is less questioned is the relationship between literacy and technology. Until quite recently, literacy has, for the most part, been associated with print technology. The increasingly important role that digital technology has taken in shaping our world has led to another defining moment in the evolution of literacy.

### The Concept of Digital

So what is digital? When you thought about your digital self in [Activity 1](your-digital-self.md), you probably thought about the digital tools and technologies that are available to you. For example: “Oh, I use text messaging on my cell phone to communicate with friends.” Or: “I use email at university on my laptop or in the computer lab to communicate with faculty.” But the digital part (just like literacy) depends on context. The technology that you use and may even take for granted is not the same technology that your grandparents use or that students in another country use. This is why the concept of digital literacy is more often now referred to as digital literacies as a plural, acknowledging the variability of what is both available and relevant.

### Digital Literacy

Since the [pioneering introduction of computers into education in the 1960s](https://thejournal.com/Articles/1997/06/01/Computers-in-Education-A-Brief-History.aspx), four key concepts that have dominated the literature on literacies related to digital technology include: information literacy, media literacy, computer literacy, and digital literacy (Brown, Czerniewicz, Huang & Mayisela, 2016). These four literacies are not competing, but in fact are necessary components of what it means to be literate in the twenty-first century. The table below presents an outline of the different terms and how they intersect:

|  | Information Literacy | Media Literacy | Computer Literacy | Digital Literacy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Definition** | the ability to locate, identify, retrieve, process and use digital information optimally (UNESCO, 2011) | the ability to access the media, to understand and to critically evaluate different aspects of the media and media content, and to create communications in a variety of contexts (European Commission, 2007) | a set of user skills that enable active participation in a society where services and cultural offerings are computer supported and distributed on the Internet (UNESCO, 2011) | those capabilities which fit an individual for living, learning and working in a digital society (JISC, 2015) |
| **Primary Focus** | information retrieval and assessment of quality | evaluation and production of media texts | skills in the use of computer-related technology | innovation, collaboration, lifelong learning |

Table 1: Summary of Key Concepts (adapted from Brown et al., 2016, CC-BY-SA)

The concept of digital literacy only started to gain attention in the last decade. Initially digital literacy was viewed primarily as the functional skills and competencies that people needed in order to use computers and the Internet. However in the last decade this has been expanded to consider the broader capacity needed to participate in a digital environment. UNESCO (2011) views digital literacy as a life skill that not only increases employability, but serves as a catalyst that “enables the acquisition of other important life skills” (p. 1).

The view of digital literacy offered by Jisc (2015) is even more comprehensive, defining digital literacy as “the capabilities which fit someone for living, learning and working in a digital society” (para. 3).  The [capabilities outlined by Jisc](https://digitalcapability.jiscinvolve.org/wp/files/2015/06/1.-Digital-capabilities-6-elements.pdf):

- information, media, data literacy (critical use);
- digital creation, scholarship and innovation (creative production);
- digital communication, collaboration and participation (participating);
- digital learning and personal/professional development (learning); and
- digital identity and wellbeing (self-actualising).
(JISC, 2015)

Beyond functional and critical skills, the definitions and digital capabilities identified here propose a particular mindset, a way of being. In particular, the last three capabilities outlined—the abilities to engage in participatory culture, to be a lifelong learner, and to manage a professional digital identity—render digital literacy remarkably different from the initial views of digital literacy simply as mastery of technical skills.

### A condition, not a threshold

Another important concept to understand when talking about digital literacies is that their aquisition is an ongoing process and dependent on context. Maintaining your digital literacy requires constant adaptation to the ever-changing digital landscape.
