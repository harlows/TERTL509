## The Concept of Digital

So what is digital? If you thought about a defining digital moment in your personal or professional life in [Activity #3](what-is-literacy.md#activity-3), you probably thought about the digital tools and technologies that are available to you. For example, the first time you used a cell phone, or the first time you saw a computer. But the digital part (just like literacy) depends on context. The technology that you use and may even take for granted is not the same technology that your grandparents use or that students in another country use. This is why the concept of digital literacy is more often now referred to as digital literacies as a plural, acknowledging the variability of what is both available and relevant.

### Digital Literacy

Since the [pioneering introduction of computers into education in the 1960s](https://thejournal.com/Articles/1997/06/01/Computers-in-Education-A-Brief-History.aspx), four key concepts that have dominated the literature on literacies related to digital technology include: information literacy, media literacy, computer literacy, and digital literacy (Brown, Czerniewicz, Huang & Mayisela, 2016). These four literacies are not competing, but in fact are necessary components of what it means to be literate in the twenty-first century. The table below presents an outline of the different terms and how they intersect:

|  | Information Literacy | Media Literacy | Computer Literacy | Digital Literacy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Definition** | the ability to locate, identify, retrieve, process and use digital information optimally (UNESCO, 2011) | the ability to access the media, to understand and to critically evaluate different aspects of the media and media content, and to create communications in a variety of contexts (European Commission, 2007) | a set of user skills that enable active participation in a society where services and cultural offerings are computer supported and distributed on the Internet (UNESCO, 2011) | those capabilities which fit an individual for living, learning and working in a digital society (JISC, 2015) |
| **Primary Focus** | information retrieval and assessment of quality | evaluation and production of media texts | skills in the use of computer-related technology | innovation, collaboration, lifelong learning |

As you see from the timeline, the concept of digital literacy only started to gain attention in the last two decades. Initially digital literacy was viewed primarily as the functional skills and competencies that people needed in order to use computers and the Internet. However in the last decade this has been expanded to consider the broader capacity needed to participate in a digital environment. UNESCO (2011) views digital literacy as a life skill that not only increases employability, but serves as a catalyst that “enables the acquisition of other important life skills” (p. 1).

### Activity #4
#### Hypothes.ising
:fas fa-clock fa-fw: *Allow about 30 minutes*
> [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is) is a way to collaboratively annotate the web.
> In this activity you will read a series of blog posts about the recent history of digital literacy and as you read, highlight and annotate things that resonate with you. As you annotate, you’re creating footprints for other students that complete the paper.
>
> Visit the Hypothes.ising activity for full instructions and Activity Bank submission link.

The view of digital literacy offered by Jisc (2015) is even more comprehensive, defining digital literacy as “the capabilities which fit someone for living, learning and working in a digital society” (para. 3).  The [capabilities outlined by Jisc](https://digitalcapability.jiscinvolve.org/wp/files/2015/06/1.-Digital-capabilities-6-elements.pdf):

- information, media, data literacy (critical use);
- digital creation, scholarship and innovation (creative production);
- digital communication, collaboration and participation (participating);
- digital learning and personal/professional development (learning); and
- digital identity and wellbeing (self-actualising).
(JISC, 2015)

Beyond functional and critical skills, the definitions and digital capabilities identified here propose a particular mindset, a way of being. In particular, the last three capabilities outlined—the abilities to engage in participatory culture, to be a lifelong learner, and to manage a professional digital identity—render digital literacy remarkably different from the initial views of digital literacy simply as mastery of technical skills.

### Activity #5
#### My (Digital) Literacy Story
:fas fa-clock fa-fw: *Allow at least 60 minutes*
> Literacy narratives are stories about reading or composing a message in any form or context. They often include poignant memories that involve a personal experience with literacy. Digital literacy narratives can sometimes be categorised as ones that focus on how the storyteller came to understand the importance of technology in their life or pedagogy. When you created your timeline for [Activity #3](what-is-literacy.md#activity-3) you might have realised one event more than the others was a defining moment.
>
> However, digital literacy narratives can also be understood as simply narratives that use a medium beyond the print-based essay to tell the story. [Mark C. Marino's digital literacy narrative](https://www.thedaln.org/#/detail/2a492736-6ec8-46b0-b9b4-6b419ad4edd3) fits into both categories. While his [writerresponsetheory.org blog](https://writerresponsetheory.org/wordpress) is no longer current, he still maintains an online presence at [markcmarino.com](https://markcmarino.com/wordpress/).
>
> Create your own literacy narrative that tells of a significant experience you had with (digital) literacy in your personal or professional life. Optionally, use a multi-modal tool that includes audio and images or video. You might like to consider depositing your literacy narrative into the [Digital Archive of Literacy Narratives](https://www.thedaln.org/).

### A condition, not a threshold

Another important concept to understand when talking about digital literacies is that their aquisition is an ongoing process. Maintaining your digital literacy requires constant adaptation to the ever-changing digital landscape. This means that digital literacy is not a one-time achievement but a continuous journey. As new technologies emerge and evolve, so too must our skills and understanding. Staying digitally literate involves regularly updating our knowledge and being open to learning new tools and platforms. To return to our guitar analogy, even experienced guitarists continue to learn and adapt to new music trends and technologies.
