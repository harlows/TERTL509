## Digital Literacy Frameworks

Although the definition of digital literacy is still debated, our understanding of the concept has been significantly shaped by the development of various supporting frameworks. Over the past 25 years, numerous frameworks have emerged. The diagram below maps some of the more well-known frameworks, illustrating that despite their diversity, they share common underlying competencies. These interconnections underscore the importance of developing a well-rounded set of digital skills to navigate the digital world safely, responsibly, and effectively.

UNESCO has developed a [Digital Competence Framework database](https://unevoc.unesco.org/home/Digital+Competence+Frameworks/) which categorises 38 frameworks into 11 distinct target groups. While most frameworks focus on education, none have been specifically developed for the higher education context.

### Context is King

The diversity of target groups in the UNESCO database demonstrates that digital literacies vary significantly based on context. For instance, the digital skills and competencies required by a primary school teacher differ from those needed by a healthcare worker. To address this, frameworks have been developed that are aimed at these sectors, but usually these are adaptions of existing frameworks. For example, Education Scotland has developed a framework for school teachers based on the DigComp2 framework, and the UK's National Health Service developed a Health and Care Digital Capabilities Framework influenced by JISC's Digital Capacity framework. In New Zealand, what work has been done is well summarised in the [TEC's Scoping a Digital Skills Framework (2023)](https://ako.ac.nz/knowledge-centre/digital-skills-framework/scoping-a-digital-skills-framework-for-aotearoa-new-zealand).

Doug Belshaw took a different approach, acknowledging the ambiguity and context dependence of digital literacy. Rather than focusing on competencies, he listed eight essential elements that could be used as building blocks to start a conversation about defining digital literacy in any given context:

1. Cultural 
2. Cognitive 
3. Constructive 
4. Communicative 
5. Confident 
6. Creative 
7. Critical 
8. Civic

While Belshaw's model has significantly contributed to the discourse on digital literacy, its elements are not explicitly referenced in major institutional frameworks.

### The HeDiCom Framework

The [the Higher Education Digital Competency (HeDiCom) Framework](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11423-023-10193-5) is relevant as its focus is solely on higher education teachers and explicitly addresses students’ digital literacy. What's more the framework acknowledges students' disciplinary or professional context. The framework comprises four main dimensions:

1.	Teachers’ digital practice
2.	Empowering students
3.	Digital literacy for lecturers, and
4.	Professional learning

The dimensions are interconnected, for example, consider *2. Empowering students* and *3. Digital literacy for lecturers*. For lecturers to be able to educate students in digital literacy for living, learning and working, they must first attend to their own digital literacy competencies. A relationship that is backed by research evidence (Falloon, 2020). Furthermore, the quality of a lecturer’s digital literacy strongly correlates with their ability to teach effectively with digital technology (Mardiana, 2024).

These describe examples of observable actions that digitally competent lecturers might display.

### Activity #6
#### Frameworks in the wild
:fas fa-clock fa-fw: *Allow about 60 minutes*
> [The University of Waikato's Graduate Attributes](https://www.waikato.ac.nz/assets/Uploads/Student-life/Teaching-and-Learning/Teaching-Development-Team/Teaching-resources/University-of-Waikato-Graduate-Attributes.pdf) outline the competencies that graduates are expected to develop during their studies. Papers taught at the University are designed to offer students the opportunity to develop these competencies. These are either explicitly integrated throughout the curriculum or taught as stand-alone “Disciplinary Foundations” papers.
>
> In this activity you will compare Graduate Attributes with the second dimension of the HeDiCom framework, *Empowering students for a digital society*, and Belshaw's eight elements.
