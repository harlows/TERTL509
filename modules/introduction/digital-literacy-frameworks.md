## Digital Literacy Frameworks

While a definition remains somewhat contested, our understanding of digital literacy as a concept has been closely associated with the development of supporting frameworks. In the last quarter of a century there has been a plethora of frameworks developed. Some of the better known frameworks are mapped below.

UNESCO has developed a [Digital Competence Framework database](https://unevoc.unesco.org/home/Digital+Competence+Frameworks/) which lists 38 frameworks. While the majority have an education focus, none have been developed specifically for the higher education context.

### The HeDiCom Framework

This paper is informed by [the Higher Education Digital Competency (HeDiCom) Framework](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11423-023-10193-5) as its focus is solely on higher education teachers and explicitly addresses students’ digital literacy. The framework comprises four main dimensions:

1.	Teachers’ digital practice
2.	Empowering students
3.	Digital literacy for lecturers, and
4.	Professional learning

The dimensions are interconnected, for example, consider *2. Empowering students* and *3. Digital literacy for lecturers*. For lecturers to be able to educate students in digital literacy for living, learning and working, they must first attend to their own digital literacy competencies. A relationship that is backed by research evidence (Falloon, 2020). Furthermore, the quality of a lecturer’s digital literacy strongly correlates with their ability to teach effectively with digital technology (Mardiana, 2024).

These describe examples of observable actions that competent lecturers might display.
