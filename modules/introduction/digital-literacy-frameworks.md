## Digital Literacy Frameworks

While a definition remains somewhat contested, our understanding of digital literacy as a concept has been closely associated with the development of supporting frameworks. In the last quarter of a century there has been a plethora of frameworks developed. Some of the better known frameworks are mapped below.

UNESCO has developed a [Digital Competence Framework database](https://unevoc.unesco.org/home/Digital+Competence+Frameworks/) which lists 38 frameworks. While many have an education focus, few have been developed for the higher education context.

This paper adopts the HeDiCom Framework as it was developed specifically for the higher education context and explicitly addresses students’ digital literacy. The framework comprises four main dimensions:

1.	Teachers’ digital practice
2.	Empowering students
3.	Digital literacy for lecturers, and
4.	Professional learning

The dimensions are interconnected, for example, consider 2. Empowering students and 3. Digital literacy for lecturers. For lecturers to be able to educate students in digital literacy for living, learning and working, they must first attend to their own digital literacy competencies. A relationship that is backed by research evidence (Falloon, 2020). Furthermore, the quality of a lecturer’s digital literacy strongly correlates with their ability to teach effectively with digital technology (Mardiana, 2024).

A set of behavioural indicators has also been developed to provide practical examples of the framework competencies. These describe examples of observable actions that competent lecturers might display.
