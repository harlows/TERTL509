## Why is Digital Literacy Important?

As you watch the following video, reflect on why digital literacy matters to you. There are many answers, and hopefully this introduction has already hinted at some of them. One is that it’s not enough in this globally connected world to just be able to use technology. You need to be able to develop socially responsible digital practices and also to contribute to digital practices in your own personal, work, and learning lives.

#### Generational View of Digital Natives

> There are many cartoons online that comment on the amusing side of this concept. Do a search on Google (or your favourite search engine) for “digital native” a cartoon. You might see images of kids looking at a book with shock and asking each other, “Where is the ‘on’ button?” Or you might see a child returning home from school walking right past their parent exclaiming, “How do you think it was? They didn’t even have Wi-Fi!”

You might be familiar with the concept of a “digital native” or the “net generation.” These terms suggest that a person who has been born or brought up during the age of digital technology will be familiar with computers and the Internet from an early age.

However, there has been a lot of criticism about the concept of the digital native because it assumes many things, not least that somehow all young people have access to technology, and that having access to technology automatically means you know how to use it effectively for tasks like studying or critical thinking.

The metaphor also oversimplifies the relationship between age and technology, reinforcing stereotypes like “old people just don't get tech.” Wrongly assuming younger generations inherently know how to use technology and that older people don’t have the same level of digital literacy as younger people.

Digital literacies are not innate; they require intentional learning. As living, learning, and working increasingly move online, educators play a critical role in developing students’ digital competencies—from evaluating online information to engaging in professional and academic digital spaces.

### A More Nuanced Model: Visitors and Residents

Rather than linking digital skills to age, David White and Alison Le Cornu offer a more nuanced model based on motivation and context. Their Visitors and Residents continuum describes two modes of online engagement:

- **Visitors** use the web for specific tasks without leaving a social trace (e.g., online banking).
- **Residents** view the web as a place to interact with others, expressing their digital identity and leaving a social footprint (e.g., posting on social media).

People often shift between these modes based on context and motivation. Therefore, the model distinguishes between personal and institutional or professional online engagement. In practice, much activity falls in the middle of the continuum, within ‘closed’ groups or communities.

Understanding models like Visitors & Residents will help you reflect on how you—and your students—engage in online spaces.
